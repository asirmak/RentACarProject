# Rent-a-Car Backend Project

This repository contains the backend of a Rent-a-Car system, built using .NET Core 3.1. The project is designed with a multi-layered architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and adherence to best practices in software development.

## Key Features

- **N-Layered Architecture**: The project is organized into multiple layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application. This promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
  
- **Web APIs**: The backend exposes a set of RESTful Web APIs for managing rental operations, customers, vehicles, and more. These APIs are designed for easy integration with frontend applications or other services.

- **SOLID Principles**: The codebase follows SOLID principles, ensuring a clean, flexible, and extensible design. This makes it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without disrupting the overall system.

- **AOP Techniques with Autofac**: The project utilizes Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) techniques through Autofac for enhanced modularity and separation of cross-cutting concerns. Key AOP features include:
  - **JWT-Based Security**: User-based authorization is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure the application.
  - **Validation**: Ensures data integrity and correctness through comprehensive validation mechanisms.
  - **Transaction Management**: Manages database transactions effectively, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
  - **Caching**: Optimizes performance by caching frequently accessed data.
  - **Logging**: Captures and stores detailed logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks and analyzes the performance of various operations to ensure optimal efficiency.

- **SQL Database**: The application uses SQL as its database management system, providing reliable and efficient data storage for all rental operations. The database schema is designed to support complex queries and ensure data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core 3.1**: A modern, cross-platform framework for building scalable and high-performance applications.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For ORM and database operations.
- **SQL Server**: The relational database management system used to store and manage data.
- **Autofac**: A powerful IoC container used to implement AOP techniques like security, validation, caching, logging, and more.
